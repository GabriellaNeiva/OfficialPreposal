The title of my project will most likely be "Unit Conversions."

My project will be a website which preforms unit conversions. It will give the viewer an option to pick what type of conversion they need and then input their own numbers into the website. It will explain the step by step method used to complete the conversion and it will be able to prove an accurate result within each time. It will be executed by the user inserting all their data for the results necessary. I do not plan on combining it with another course.

I think I could accomplish a user input setting on a website in which they can get the desired result of their conversion. The best outcome I hope to accomplish would be that with the results the user would also be able to see the work behind the answer.

The next step for me would be researching about creating a website. With this step, I also plan on getting a list of all the unit conversions necessary combined onto a document in order to get a view of how much work is gonna be necessary. The overall next step is to be able to create the website itself and to be able to produce the desired results for each different type of conversion.
